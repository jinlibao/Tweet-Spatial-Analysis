Notes:
------

Done: 001: Draw ellipse on selecting a user
Dependent on 003
20181122: Draw an ellipse at the correct position:
Ref: https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/reference/models/glyphs/ellipse.html#bokeh.models.glyphs.Ellipse
Can I define this as a separate course - independent of the circles?
Can draw a basic ellipse.

OnGoing: 002: Understand mapping of ellipse data to actual drawing: Added 20181122: Started 20181127: Completed 20181129
Started looking at the general equations for an Ellipse.
Don't get too hung up on how the Standard Deviational Ellipse is actually calculated, as all this does is to provide me with the x/y ratio, area and angle.
What I need to focus on is the correct drawing of this ellipse (i.e. angle measured from which axis) on the map.
Assuming the SDE follows http://www.portailsig.org/content/qgis-des-ellipses-de-deviation-standard-sde-un-plugin-standard-deviational-ellipse-des-scrip
Follow: Clarifying the Standard Deviational Ellipse - Jianxin Gong - 2002.pdf
20181129: Get hold of the original raw data to visually test that the drawn ellipses look correct.

Done: 003: Toggle ellipse on/off: Added 20181122: Started 20181122: Completed 20181202
20181122: Base functionality on https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/styling.html#userguide-styling-selected-unselected-glyphs
Once a circle has been selected - switch this button on - then allow user to toggle the ellipse on/off
20181202: Toggle widget added.

Done: 004: Look up how to create dissolve of intersecting areas: Added 20181122: Started 20181127: Completed 20181202
Looked up a variety of potential libraries.
20181202: Will use shapely.

Done: 005: Switch between working/non-working and medium/mean datasets - drop-down menu: Added 20181122: Started 20181129: Completed 20181130
Created the three data sets.
20181130: Started to wire in the drop down callback with swapping between the data sets.
Although data sets are being swapped - the showing of the appropriate ellipse is not.
Fixed: Wasn't defining the tweet_data as a global within the function call.

Done: 008: How much pre-processing regards an individual and the data points within their area? Vs doing on the fly: Added 20181122: Started 20181126: Completed 20181130
20181130: As a whole follow the strategy of pre-processing as much as possible.
Consider this as part of 012

InProgress: 010 Add Logging:
Ref: https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/reference/util.html#bokeh-util-logconfig:
By default, logging is not configured, to allow users of Bokeh to have full control over logging policy. However, it is
useful to be able to enable logging arbitrarily during when developing Bokeh. This can be accomplished by setting the
environment variable BOKEH_PY_LOG_LEVEL. The default logging level is none.
Looks like this needs to be configured on the command line when using the bokeh server
bokeh serve --show 5880_geog_dev_02.py --log-level debug --log-file output.txt --log-format "%(asctime)s %(levelname)s: %(message)s"
Ref: Python Bokeh Logger: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45376571/python-bokeh-logger

Done: 011: Understand how to make a callback to the server when not using a widget and return values.
Already know this works when using a widget so maybe start there e.g. press button to show ellipse - this then makes a callback.
20181126: Work around: Had to add the array index to a paragraph object that could then be read in the server callback.

OnGoing: 012: Look at pre-processing the (latitude, longitude) coordinate projections: Added 20181122: Started 20181126: Completed 20181129
20181126: Create a class that loads and cleans the original tweet data.
To assist development, add a 'number of rows to process' variable.
Have removed rows containing NaN.
Working on identifying rows that contain the string 'Infinity' - this is not np.inf.
Consider rows where the 'area' column has a value of 0.
20181127: Even if the area is 0 then it's still a spatial point - consider what it means? i.e. they always tweet from the same location.
So, no ellipise, but they can still be in someone else's ellipse.
So, keep data point in, but flag that they do not have an ellipse.
20181129: Calculated width, height from area and ratio.
20181130: Get hold of the original raw data to visually test that the drawn ellipses look correct.

Done: 014: Start understanding how to dissolve polygons together: Added 20181127: Started 20181127: Completed ??
Started looking at potential (Open Source) libraries - including Shapely + GeoPandas
As with 004: Will use shapely that has dissolve functionality.
Basic approach will be to define each ellipse as a point set/polygon and then use the shapely dissolve tool to create a single polygon.
Confirm that the ellipse definition defined in shapely maps accurately to those drawn in bokeh.
Created a set of ellipse points using shapely and they DO match the ellipse shape drawn by bokeh.
Create a list of ellipse details, then for each ellipse calculate it's points to create a polygon.
From this list of polygons perform a shapely cascaded_union. Appears to be working.

Done: 015: Step back and profile the data - this will then be used to direct how to clean it and which columns to focus on: Added 20181128: Started 20181128: Completed 20181128
x/y-all-tweets: Infinity: 47 : 0: 8
x/y-working-tweets: Infinity: 90 : 0: 8
x/y-nonworking-tweets: Infinity: 72 : 0: 6
area-all-tweets: 0.0: 115
area-working-tweets: 0.0: 183
area-nonworking-tweets: 0.0: 162
Used Data Profiling tool - results in data_profiling folder.
20181129: Looking at the 57902 rows - none of the latitude or longitude values are NaN - i.e. they ALL have a spatial position.
area-all-tweets: 99 nan : 115 0
area-nonworking-tweets: 118 nan : 162 0
area-working-tweets: 120 nan : 183 0
For area-all-tweets:
- the x/y-all-tweets values are [NaN, Infinity, 0] - but there is a value for the theta-all-tweets column
- areas with NaN - x/y are NaN - theta mixture of NaN and values
This is the same for areas for working and non-working.
So, what to do?
An area of 0 is allowed - potentially implying they don't move - always tweeting from the same location.
An area of NaN? Mark as '-1' to identify undefined.
So, don't remove rows with an NaN value - clean it instead.
Do I need to clean angles that are nan? Why not just check for it when the data point is selected, and if nan then don't draw.

Done: 017: How to check for a point in an ellipse - how to optimize this over the entire 50K data set (x 3): Added 20181129: STarted 20181129: Completed 20181202
Have found the basic formula: Point and ellipse (rotated) position test: algorithm:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7946187/point-and-ellipse-rotated-position-test-algorithm
Perform some quick bounding box / circle test to disclude other data points quickly, before applying more computationally expensive ellipse check.
20181202: This will be pre-processed.

InProgress: 018: Consider how to use visualization to represent area / number of tweets within ellipse etc - maybe add to the hover tool?: Added: 20181130: Started 20181202
Take a look at bokeh.colors: https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/reference/colors.html
20181208: Have added a 'color' column to the source circle CDS.
Explore various maps. There is a concentration of counts in the low 10s - which is hidden using a linear map.

Done: 023: Check the drawing of the ellipse if the area is 0 or -1: Added 20181130: Started 20181130: Completed 20181130
Dependent on 024 as although I can find an ID where the area is 0 or -1, need a convenient way to then locate and select it.
On first look it appears that nothing appears to happen? Which is fine, but was semi expecting an error of some kind.
Added check for the returned dataframe of the entered ID being empty. If it is empty, i.e. no row with that ID, then the find circle is cleared.

Done: 024: Allow the user to select a point by entering the ID in a text book. This will require some form of automatic zoom to 'fly' to the selected point: Added 20181130: Started 20181130: Completed 20181130
Added text input box and button to 'find id'.
How do I define/change the selected data point?
Potentially draw a circle around the data point - but it will still need to be explicitly selected.
Circle drawn. Need to clear this circle selection on some action.
Circle cleared when user selects (another) point.

Done: 025: Understand why data point ID 2760872119 is not within it's ellipse? Surely this can't happen as the data point is the location for ellipse? Added 20181130: Started 20181130: Completed 20181130
Looks like this might have just been an error, as it looks fine now.

Done: 026: On text, have single ID (idx) string - then parse this backend: Added 20181130: Started 20181130: Completed 20181130
Only using the text_id widget, and then some basic string manipulation to extract the idx from between the brackets.

20181211: Used radio buttons. Work better than the drop down.

Done: 029: Consider adding filters/sliders for some bins of 'num of local data points', 'ellipse area' and other measures: Added 20181201: Started 20181207: Completed 20181217
20181208: Range Sliders for sibling count and area.
Add for 'distance between working and non working', and for 'ratio'.
20181217:
Theta/Angle ranges from -pi/2 to +pi/2 and NaN
Ratio from 0 then 0.70 to 9E+05 and Infinity / NaN
Distance: 0 to 841 and a single NaN - can we calculate this distance? (User-ID: 1210087572)
Set NaN values to -1
Observations:
- when ratio is 0 then the area is also 0
- when ratio is Infinity - area is 0
- when ratio is Nan - area is Nan or 0
Regards the distance, I could just add another column to each of the datasets - would mean not having to create a separate 'distance' file and all the required 'wiring'.
If distance is NaN, then it is currently set to -1.
Added filters for medians distance and ratio.

This occurs when the user clicks on the map but no circle is selected i.e. unselecting everything.
So, actually, I should be clearing the ellipse and circles inside ellipse instead.
This doesn't appear to be a problem any more?

InProgress: 032: Consider optimization as a whole over the entire 50K data set (x 3): Added 20181202: Started 20181202
Related to task 063
On home desktop, 10K points is slow. It loads within less than 10s which is good, but zooming and panning is jerky.
How many points have a count less than 0?
Maybe having the slider that controls which points are displayed w.r.t. count will help.
Does Bokeh provide anything similar to Folium/Leaflet that groups points depending on zoom factor?
Can I somehow plot something similar to Folium's MarkerCluster?
Try 'Controlling Level of Detail' under: https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/tools.html
How can I get the currect axis scale / zoom factor.
Can I maybe turn rendering off / down-sample while moving/zooming?
Once a point is selected - remove points outside a certain range?
Only show datapoint and siblings? i.e. only points in it's ellipse?
20181215: Started looking at the LOD/Pan events.
20181218: Created a lod dummy renderer that is need to detect the change in the related CDS, which then calls the on_change function.
Can set the visible attribute of the circle renderer to tre/false to turn drawing on/off.
LOD events are also called when the map is panned - so no need to also implement specific pan events.
Need to test with 10,000 points to understand performance.
20181219: Tested with 10,000 points. There is a few seconds delay from starting to zoom/pan before the points are cleared.
Considering adding pan events back in.
20181222: Explore the use of the MouseMove / MouseWheel events. There is a definite delay in detecting the LOD/Pan events and reacting.
Concerns that the basic UI Event implementation might not be up to the job:
Generalizing Events: https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/wiki/Generalizing-Events
Consider providing buttons to explicitly turn points on/off.
20181224: Added toggle button to turn data points on/off - or more explicitly make the circle renderer invisible/visible.
This doesn't actually seem to improve pan/zoom performace - I suspect the data is still being 'processed' even though invisible.
Go back to making the circle data set empty.
This works much better. There is a delay 'loading' the circles back up.

Done: 033: Need to save the pre-processed data out to a file and then load into app: Added 20181202: Started 20181203: Completed 20181205
Look at Bokeh's Mapping Geo Data: https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/geo.html for some direction.

Simply used Pandas Dataframe to_json / read_json - appears super quick (for 1000 x 3 points).

InProgress: 034: BBug: A user is able to select multiple data points when the scale is zoomed out enough - only want ability to select a single one: Added 20181202: Started 20181203:
Look at Folium/Leaflet that uses a 'group pin' that indicates X individual points are grouped together, which gradually zooms down into single pins.

Done: 035: Consider drawing all the ellipses of the datapoints within the selected datapoint - this is different to drawing the single dissolve: Added 20181202: Started 20181202: Completed 20181202
We already have the list of enclosed datapoints.
Create another data source to define the ellipses for the enclosed datapoints.
The idea is to allow the user to view the extent of the ellipses which might give a different perspective than just the single dissolve.
This will also act as a visual check for the dissolve.
Ellipses outline drawn using a toggle switch.

Done: 036: Change buttons (where appropriate) to toggles to switch things on/off: Added 20181202: Completed 20181202
Consider what to do on change datasets? Toggle everything off, or re-calculate what's turned on?
Decided to toggle everything off.

Done: 038: Display both 'working'/'non-working' ellipses together: Added 20181202: Started 20181203: Completed 20181217
Consider whether to display both on the same single map, or potentially on two maps. This will be influenced by how 'crowded' the map looks having both datasets on a single map.
If there is close localisation then this could look messy. But there is some benefit being able to view the overlap - potentially have a 'blending slider' that controls for example transparency.
Consider how plots can be linked? e.g. selecting a point on 'working' selects the same point on 'non-working'.
20181205: For the first implementation use a slide to blend between them on a single map.
Basic slider working for blending between the data poitns ellipse.
20181211: Thoughts on the UI: two checkboxes (working/non-working). If either dataset is selected then the associated checkbox will be active.
Have slide for blending - can this be de-activated if both check boxes are selected?
Why not actually just have a simple toggle blending on/off - doesn't this simply the logic?
Using toggle approach. Slider is disabled if not toggled.
Next steps:
1) Create CDS: selected_circle, sde_ellipse, siblings, sibling_ellipses, patch_dissolve.
2) Populate with other dataset of working/nonworking
3) Create plot renderers.
Can I reuse existing clear and update functions, and define the tweet_data to use?
Add logic that if 'all' is selected then toggle blend is disabled, and any existing blend is cleared?
20181212: Need to disable the blend slider on start up.
Blend slider disabled on start up.
20181215: Remember, we're only belending (at this stage) between working and non-working to this affects when the toggle blend button is active.
toggle_button initially disabled as starting dataset is 'all'
Implementation:
If blend_dataset is not None then process the various elements.
Add transparency to the various renderers.
Start with the ellipse then add the other elements.
20181216: Blending working for the sde ellipse.
Looks like I might not be able to blend the path:

20181217: I can change the line and fill alpha by directly modifying the attributes via the renderer. Is this a bit of a hack? Yeah - but seems the only way I'll be able to do it for a patch.
Add alpha to sibling points. Implemented by modifing the renderer directly.
Blending functionality is in place - need to tidy up the toggle states wrt what is shown.
Can blend selected circle, sde ellipse, sibling ellipses and path.
One observation of modifying the renderer directly is that I'm NOT having to re-calculate the points / patch - which is much faster.

20181204: Fundamentally, should I be calculating the ellipse points in non-projected EPSG:4326 space, and then projecting these points into EPSG:3857?
It's down to understanding the underlying process applied to the original data.

Directional Distribution (Standard Deviational Ellipse) (Spatial Statistics): http://resources.esri.com/help/9.3/arcgisengine/java/gp_toolref/spatial_statistics_tools/directional_distribution_standard_deviational_ellipse_spatial_statistics_.htm
- Usage tips This tool honors the environment output coordinate system. Feature geometry is projected to the output coordinate system prior to analysis. All mathematical computations are based on the output coordinate system spatial reference.
- Calculations based on either Euclidean or Manhattan distance require projected data to accurately measure distances.
How Directional Distribution: Standard Deviational Ellipse (Spatial Statistics) works: http://resources.esri.com/help/9.3/arcgisengine/java/gp_toolref/spatial_statistics_tools/how_directional_distribution_colon_standard_deviational_ellipse_spatial_statistics_works.htm
- A common way of measuring the trend for a set of points or areas is to calculate the standard distance separately in the x and y directions. These two measures define the axes of an ellipse encompassing the distribution of features. The ellipse is referred to as the standard deviational ellipse, since the method calculates the standard deviation of the x coordinates and y coordinates from the mean center to define the axes of the ellipse. 
About projected coordinate systems: http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/9.3/index.cfm?TopicName=About%20projected%20coordinate%20systems
- A projected coordinate system is defined on a flat, two-dimensional surface. Unlike a geographic coordinate system, a projected coordinate system has constant lengths, angles, and areas across the two dimensions. A projected coordinate system is always based on a geographic coordinate system that is in turn based on a sphere or spheroid.

- Unit: metre
- Scope: Certain Web mapping and visualisation applications. It is not a recognised geodetic system: for that see ellipsoidal Mercator CRS code 3395 (WGS 84 / World Mercator).
- Remarks: Uses spherical development of ellipsoidal coordinates. Relative to WGS 84 / World Mercator (CRS code 3395) errors of 0.7 percent in scale and differences in northing of up to 43km in the map (equivalent to 21km on the ground) may arise.

Web Mercator  The Standard for Sharing Data on the Web: https://www.esri.com/events/seminars/bettermaps/~/media/files/pdfs/events/seminars/bettermaps/materials/pdfs/webmercatorsmnrbrochure.pdf
Many organizations use geographic information system (GIS) data stored in a local  projected coordinate system. When preparing to share maps or layers on the Web, it is recommended to reproject your source data to the Web Mercator coordinate system. Doing so will ensure that your map data is located correctly and aligns properly with  other services such as popular content providers Microsoft®   Bing Maps, Google Maps, and ESRI ArcGIS Online, which have standardized their services on the Web Mercator coordinate system.
Web Mercator projection: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator_projection
- Web Mercator, Google Web Mercator, Spherical Mercator, WGS 84 Web Mercator or WGS 84/Pseudo-Mercator is a variant of the Mercator projection and is the de facto standard for Web mapping applications. It rose to prominence when Google Maps adopted it in 2005. It is used by virtually all major online map providers, including Google Maps, MapBox, Bing Maps, OpenStreetMap, Mapquest, Esri, and many others. Its official EPSG identifier is EPSG:3857, although others have been used historically.
- Properties: Web Mercator is a slight variant of the Mercator projection, one used primarily in Web-based mapping programs. It uses the same formulas as the standard Mercator as used for small-scale maps. However, the Web Mercator uses the spherical formulas at all scales whereas large-scale Mercator maps normally use the ellipsoidal form of the projection. The discrepancy is imperceptible at the global scale but causes maps of local areas to deviate slightly from true ellipsoidal Mercator maps at the same scale. This deviation becomes more pronounced further from the equator, and can reach as much as 40km on the ground. While the Web Mercator's formulas are for the spherical form of the Mercator, geographical coordinates are required to be in the WGS 84 ellipsoidal datum. This discrepancy causes the projection to be slightly non-conformal. General lack of understanding that the Web Mercator differs from standard Mercator usage has caused considerable confusion and misuse: For all these reasons, the United States Department of Defense through the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency has declared this map projection to be unacceptable for any official use.
ISSUE: So, I'm unsure how the SDE area and xy_ratio have been calculated if not performed in projected coordinate (x,y) space compared to geographic coordinate (lat, lon) space?
Maybe I just have to define the spatial reference when calculating the area? Or something?
SOLVED: Issues caused by miss-intepreting an ellipses 'a' and 'b' values compared to bokeh's 'width' and 'height' values.
Rememeber, 'a' and 'b' are mesaured from the center out along the axis. While 'width' and 'height' refer to the distances across the axis from one side of the ellipse to the other.
So width = 2*a and height=2*b

Done: 050: Add a colour palette to represent sibling count: Added 20181206: Started 20181207: Completed 20190108
Tried a linear colour scheme and a 1.0 - 1.0/(1.0 + count) version.
There is predominently a high grouping between 0 and the low 10s - maybe create a more tailed palette that specifically bins the palette?
20181231: Using the palettes and functionality defined in: https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/reference/palettes.html#bokeh-palettes
Start with the histograms.
20190101: Is it worth considering having a separate colour for when count is 0?
Added 'Perceptualy Uniform Sequential colormaps' plasma palette.
Need to move the color definition for each point to the pre-processing stage.
20190105 Also consider making the choice of the palatte configureable: cividis, gray/grey, inferno, magma, plasma, viridis
Does moving the defining of the colour to the pre-processing stage require to load the config file?
In some sense yes, as the defining of the bins for the count is required.
Could even consider as a stage after pre-processing, but before visualization - allowing different bins to be considered.

Done: 056: Consider potentially pre-processing dissolve area so the map can be filtered on that: Added 20181208: Started 20181218: Completed 20190107
This actually has some weight to it.
Preprocessing 10000 data points, the max count is 8160
This will take some seconds (need to test/confirm) to do in really time - and potentially performed multiple times if a point is selected/de-selcted multiple times.
Results could be 'cached' - but this would need implementing.
How large would files become? 1,000 400K : 10,000 17 to 20MB : 50,000?
This also has an impact on load time.
This does imply that a review on the general pre-processing architecture needs to be considered.

Done: 057: Add numerical count and %s respect to number of points for each slider: Added 20181208: Started 20181208: Completed 20181208
This is the number w.r.t. to all the filters, not individual filters.
Example: Although starting with 1000 points, as soon as the sibling count is applied, this drops to 996?
This is because some rows have an area of -1, so the area filter removes these.
Need to modify code so that all filters are actually applied together.
Consider being able to select which filters to apply using a check box.

Added buttons to the count slider as we need the +-1 precision when selecting. Do we need the same level of precision for the area slider?
Lets say yes, as we do have tweets with an area of -1, so it might be useful to view areas from say -100 to 0 - again difficult to get this level of precision just with a slide.

InProgress: 064: Evolving from 049, consider adding various appropriate histograms to the page, and creating click-able from the various bins: Added 20181210: Started 20181218:
How much can / should this be processed?
Creating on the fly/as start up wrt 1,000 / 10,000 / 50,000 points.
Also consider having non-regular bins - consider sibling counts: e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6-10, 11-20, 21-50, 50-100, >100
How does this affect the x-axis scale/representation?
20181222: Started looking to research if bin sizes could be defined.
20181226: Added basic histogram to the plot in main.py.
Integrate the count histogram into the TweetDataController and MapWidgets classes.
20181230: Histogram working correctly and changes when active dataset is changed.
Add hover over the quads
20181231: Consider putting the count histogram into a separate class?
And a second histogram - SDE area.
Second chart added. Need to look at creating 'histogram class'.
Created Histogram Plot, Controller and Data classes. The JavaScript related callbacks for Hover and Tap have to be functions so are ecxplicitly defined rather than being in a class.
Was able to add third 'distance' histogram in under five minutes.
Remember that this only represents the distance between working and non-working so does NOT change when the dataset is changed.
Added fourth ratio histogram.
20190101: Still need to add filter by functionality.

Done: 065: BBug with circle_renderer.selection_glyph and point 2429397887 - cheated by setting alpha to 0.0 to work: Added 20181211: Started 20181211: Completed 20181211
Replicate:
Find 2429397887
Switch to working
Switch back to all - erronous point appears?
Appears to be connected to circle_renderer.selection_glyph
Cheated by making alpha 0.0.
BUT why for this point and hardly any others?
20181211: Replicated problem in earlier version.
Issue: ValueError("expected an element of either String, Dict(Enum('expr', 'field', 'value', 'transform'), Either(String, Instance(Transform), Instance(Expression), Float)) or Float, got array([527, 120,  77,  29,  24,  29,  18,  10,   8,   7,  38,  14,  17,\n        36,  18,  10,  11,   5,   0,   1], dtype=int64)")


Done: 067: Create a Git repo around the first version: Added 20181211: Started 20181211: Completed 20181211
Created repository with dev branch.

InProgress: 068: Think about a map of overlapping SDEs - use grey scale + transparency - maybe convert patches to a raster: Added 20181211: Started 20181211:
Can I convert the shape patch into a raster?
Rather than using transparency do I need to look at aggregation / sum of counts?

Done: 070: Restructure code to use a controller to interface from the widgets to the data: Added 20181212: Started 20181212
Basic idea is to allow the controller to manage which of the three data sets is being displayed and the blending between the working and non working.
Implementation appears to be working.
Merged work from branch dev_tweet_class into dev

Done: 071: Can I dynamically update user info: Added 20181215: Started 20181215: Completed 20181215
Can I use the TweetDataCOntroller: selected_circle_changed to update the user info?
Wired in widgets for info to the controller and this worked.
Consider displaying the area and number of siblings as well - although these will need updating when the dataset is changed.
Also, why do I need separate widgets for these? Can I just not now use a single one?
Modified to use a single Div that also allows text formatting such as new line <br> and bold <b>.
Added area and count. Updated when changing datasets.

Done: 072: Add scale to map and units to details for area Added 20181215: Started 20190101: Completed 20190101
Add axis labels and projection: epsg:3857: WSG 84 Web Mercator
Added axis labels

Done: 075: BBug: IndexError: Added 20181217: Started Added 20181217: Completed 20181217: Reopened 20181217: Completed 20181218

IndexError('index 0 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 0')
Start looking from the radio_button_data_type_change callback in the MapWidgets class.
Starting with working as active and toggle blend active, the error appeared when toggle blend was pressed i.e. made active.
Solved. Was calling turn_blend_on and subsequent update calls that used circle_idx before it had been set.
20181218: Similar problem in the update_selection_details function. Resolved

Done: 078: Understand the datasets better wrt filters. Using 10,000 datapoints when I reset the filters to their minimum? Added 21081219: Started 20181219: Completed 20181219
Issue was infact caused by increase in max count, area and probably distance.
This can be solved by implementing task 062
20181223: Approach: Expand the FilterSettings class to be the beginning of the global configuration.
Created and parsed tweet_spatail_analysis.ini

Done: 080: BBug: ValueError('Out of range float values are not JSON compliant') when pressing Toggle Siblings: ID: 1416678168: Added 20181219: Started 20181219: Completed 20181224

Check data for NaN values.
20181224: Issue appears when toggling siblings
The following occurs when toggling dissolve:
ValueError('No Shapely geometry can be created from null value') which I assume is related.
Use: 1416678168
Caused by points having 'a' and 'b' values set to -1.0

Done: 083: Look at pre-processing the dissolve area to be able to filter on this: Added 20181231: Started 20190105: Completed 20190107
Add 'dissolve' column to TweetData df.
Move the update_dissolve method in MapTweetData, into TweetData
Same as 056:
20190107: Range Slider added.

Done: 084: Take another looking at adding tabs now that we have a figure for the count histogram: Added 20181231: Started 20181231: Completed 20181231
Followed https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/reference/models/widgets.panels.html and it worked.
Successfully added a second histogram to the tab.

Done: 085: Can I get the hover data to follow the mouse? On histograms the info can always be seen: Added 20190102: Started 20190102: Completed 20190102
Try using the point_policy for the HoverTool.
This worked.

Done: 086: Explore putting the ids/idxs data pointing to siblings in a separate database: Added 20190105: Started 20190105: Completed 20190107
The size of te dataset files are for 1K points:370-413K to 10K points 17-20M - what size will they be for 50K
Load time is already noticeable for 10K points.
Consider separating out the sibling data ids/idxs from the main individual points.
Either into a separate file or potential an individual file for each data point.
The latter method also allows the dissolve to be pre-processed and stored - which itself will start to become significant as the count of the siblings increase.
Could have a very basic cache where sibling info is stored in memory once loaded - so loaded only once.
Development Steps:
1) Pre-process data - create siblings ids/idxs
2) Calculate dissolve area and polygon - if count == 0 then there is no dissolve.
3) Save ids/idxs and polygon into separate file (if count > 0) -
Are there cases when working has no dissolve and non-working does?
i.e. working has no siblings but non-working does?
If no siblings, then the dissolve is simply the data point SDE ellipse.
So, does this imply EVERY data point will have a file even if sibling count is 0 as they ALL have a dissolve?
20190106: Created a SiblingDataManager class to 'cache' the sibling data.
Do I put this in TweetDataController, or deeper into the MapTweetData?
The current architecture leaves the update of the siblings at the TweetData level - follow a similar implementation - so the latter.
Initial tests using 10K points appear promising regards panning/zooming and filter.
20190107 Further tests appear good. Consider complete and open up another tasks if errors/problems appear.

Done: 088: Change the 'Find ID' circle colour. Difficult to view against plasma palette. Maybe change order of draw. Added 20190106: Started 20190107: Completed 20190107
CHnaged colour to darkgreen and line width of 2
It's already drawn last, so should be on top of all other rendering.

Done: 089: Look at time to start up with 10K points: Added 20190106: Started 20190107: Completed 20190107
Slow startup time caused by re-calculating the colour on start up. Removed this, as it will be put in the pipeline before start up.
Took seconds to load.

Done: 090: Need to modify the colours when blending to distinguish datasets: Added 20190106: Started 20190108: Completed 20190108
Using the RdYlGn divergent color palette

Done: 092: Consider preprocessing defaults. Maybe set area/dissolve to 0 rather than -1: Added 20190106: Started 20190108: Completed 20190108
There is an issue with filtering:
Defaults area 0 : ratio 0 : dissolve 0
If you turn the filters off/on then 10,000 drops down to 9948
ratio -1 : 9981
all three need to be negative to filter back to 10,000
consider making the defaults for all three to 0
In the pre-processing stage have set the defaults for area, ratio, a, b, distance to 0.0
